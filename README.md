## Hello <a name="hello">
I will start to learn Python for Data science. Python can be used for general purposes to build anything. It is open source and can have many packages to help you with your needs.

## First Python Code <a name="first">
Using your (Code) and type  
1`# Example, do not modify!`  
2`print(5 / 8)`  
3  
4`# Print the sum of 7 and 10`  
5`print(7+10)`  

Run the code and see the output  

`# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)`

`# Print the sum of 7 and 10
print(7+10)
0.625
17`

## Python Calculator <a name="calculator">
Using your (Code) and type  
1`# Addition`  
2`print(4+5)`  
3  
4`# Subtraction`  
5`print(5-5)`
6  
7`# Multiplication`
8`print(3*5)`
9  
10`# Division`
11`print(10/2)`

Run the code and see the output  

`# Addition`  
`print(4+5)`  
  
`# Subtraction`  
`print(5-5)`  
  
`# Multiplication`  
`print(3*5)`  
  
`# Division`  
`print(10/2)`

## Variables and Types <a name="vartypes">
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc..

### Variables
- Specific, case-sensitive name
- Call up value through a variable name

### Calculate BMI with Variables
if we put Varibles `height` and have it equal  `1.79` and another variable `weight` and have that equal `68.7`. If we recall `height` it will give us back the value of `1.79`1.79`.  

To calculate BMI we need to use the Equation `BMI = Weight / height^2`.  
`68.7 / 1.79**2  |  weight / height**2`  
`   21.4413      |     21.4413`
